# Base Client

### Features

- CommandManager (with two commands, "irc" and "set")
- ModuleManager (with one example module, and the "AdvancedTabGui" module AND module settings)
- EventManager (not all of the event handlers are working or cancellable, some marked as cancellable are not _yet_)
- FileManager
- ConfigManager
- TabGui
- Module rainbow "ArrayList"
- Overlay above hotbar
- Alt Manager (By Russian412)
- NahrFont ported to 1.8.8 (By Russian412)
- IRC Client

------------

### Coming Soon / TODO
- Better hotbar overlay
- Better module "arraylist"
- Better font manager
- Help command
- Better FileManager / ConfigManager
- Enhance some code

------------


### Most Important TODOs
- Create a wiki for every part of the client
- Finish all of the event handlers
- Finish the TabGui, so that the module settings can be changed from there (they can be seen already, but not changed)

------------

##### Any help is highly appreciated, I cannot put all of my time into this project, but expect updates to be coming pretty soon
