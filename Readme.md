# Minecraft Hacked Client Base Client 1.8.8 (with optifine)

### Setup

- Decompile the [Minecraft Coders Pack 918 (1.8.8)](http://www.modcoderpack.com/files/mcp918.zip)
- Download the project as ZIP
- Delete the "src" folder's content
- Copy the ZIP content over to the "src" folder
- Launch Eclipse into the "eclipse" folder as workspace

------------

### Features

- CommandManager (with ~~two~~ three commands, "irc", ~~and~~ "set" and "help")
- ModuleManager (with module settings, one example module (the fly/flight module) and the "AdvancedTabGui" module)
- EventManager (not all of the event handlers are working or cancellable, some marked as cancellable are not _yet_)
- FileManager
- ConfigManager
- [TabGUI](https://github.com/OxideWaveLength/Minecraft-Hack-BaseClient/wiki/Tab-GUI)
- Module rainbow "ArrayList"
- Overlay above hotbar
- Alt Manager (By Russian412)
- NahrFont ported to 1.8.8 (By Russian412)
- IRC Client

------------

### Coming Soon / TODO

- Better hotbar overlay
- Better module "arraylist"
- Better font manager
- ~~Help command~~ (done)
- Better FileManager / ConfigManager
- Enhance some code
- Multi Versioning! Exactly, joining 1.12 servers in 1.8.8...

------------

### Most Important TODOs

- Create a wiki for every part of the client
- Finish all of the event handlers (almost there!)
- Finish the TabGui, so that the module settings can be changed from there (they can be seen already, but not changed)

------------

##### Any help is highly appreciated, I cannot put all of my time into this project, but expect updates to be coming pretty soon
